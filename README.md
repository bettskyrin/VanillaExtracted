A vanilla+ experience! Virtually every aspect of the game has been reworked in a way that adds a fresh coat of paint to the game, without losing that "Minecrafty" feel!

From food to foes, you'll be able to find new, yet oddly familiar features inspired by Minecraft Game Design, community ideas, and more.

Read the wiki for more information.

Notes from Kyrin:
Much like the mod itself, file structure is meant to replicate Mojang, however I do my best to comment things to make it easier on anyone else reading the code.
